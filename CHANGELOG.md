## Development

* In token blacklist app, changed `OutstandingToken.jti` field to char field to
  better reflect JWT spec.
* Renamed `AUTH_TOKEN_CLASS` setting to `AUTH_TOKEN_CLASSES`.  This setting now
  specifies a list of token classes (or class paths) which are used to verify
  tokens which are submitted for authorization.  This will hopefully help
  anyone wishing to gradually migrate between using different token types.
* Removed support for extensible JWT backends.  We're just going to use PyJWT
  exclusively to simplify things.
* Added support for more crypto algorithms.  All HMAC and RSA variants from
  PyJWT now supported.
* Renamed `SECRET_KEY` setting to `SIGNING_KEY`.
* The renamed `SIGNING_KEY` setting now acts doubly as a symmetric
  signing/verification key for HMAC algorithms and as a private key for RSA
  algorithms.
* Added `VERIFYING_KEY` setting for use with RSA algorithms.
* Removed undocumented `TOKEN_BACKEND_CLASS` setting.

## Version 2.1

* Switched to using [PyJWT](https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt) as the
  underlying library for signing and verifying tokens.
